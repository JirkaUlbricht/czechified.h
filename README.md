# Czechified C

Czechified library for the C language based on czech.h by Toaster192

## Usage

This project resides solely in a single header file, aptly named `czechified.h`.
Download that file alone, or along this whole repository, and then, after
including it in your source files like you would with any other header, you
will be fully set up! (Just make sure you use relatively modern compiler)

## Compiler support

We have this project tested and provably working with
[Clang](http://releases.llvm.org/download.html)
Newer versions of gcc are also known to work, as well as some other compilers

## Obligatory "Hello World" example

```c
#include "czechified.h"
#include <stdio.h>

intýžr mejn() {
    printef("Helou world!");

    retrn zirou;
}

```
